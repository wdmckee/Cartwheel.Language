Not sure if I need a Syntax Result yet or not.
Could return the data asociated with the IL or even cache



----- Parser:

Testing works like this...

TestSuccess(expression, target function, return type)
so for example
TestSuccess("a-b", "Parse_Valid_Letter_Sequence_1", "Valid_Letter_Sequence");
would test is the input expression "a-b" was a valid [Parse_Valid_Letter_Sequence_1].
It would test that it returns a [Valid_Letter_Sequence] (or can be cast to it) though since we don't return sub-sequences.
